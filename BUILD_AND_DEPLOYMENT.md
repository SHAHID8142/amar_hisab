# Build and Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions on how to build and deploy the Amar Hisab application for different platforms.

## Android

### Build

To build the Android application, run the following command:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

This will generate a release APK file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.

### Deployment

You can deploy the generated APK file to the Google Play Store or distribute it manually.

## iOS

### Build

To build the iOS application, run the following command:

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

This will generate a release build in the `build/ios/` directory. You will need a Mac with Xcode installed to build the iOS application.

### Deployment

You can deploy the generated build to the Apple App Store using Xcode or other distribution tools.

## Web

### Build

To build the web application, run the following command:

```bash
flutter build web
```

This will generate a release build in the `build/web/` directory.

### Deployment

You can deploy the generated web build to any web server that can host static files, such as Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or your own server.
